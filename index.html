      <p> Julie D’Aubigny was one of those rare individuals who truly lived life to the fullest. She lived a rock ’n’ roll lifestyle before it was even a thing and her deeds have yet to be surpassed even by the most adventurous, outlandish individuals. A duellist, an opera singer, a bi-sexual and an icon, Julie D’Aubigny scandalised 17th century France with her affairs, exploits and charmed King Louis XIV with her untameable spirit. She lived a life of love and passion and when she died at the age of just 33, France, and the world would never be able to forget her.</p>
